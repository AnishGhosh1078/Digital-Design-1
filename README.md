• Implementation of AND gate 

• Implementation of 8-bit adder

• Implementation of XOR gate

Xilinx ISE is being used to simulate the hardware designs and the main simulation tool used is iSim.

# Implementation of AND gate

The code consists of two major units: entity declaration and architecture body.The entity declaration is specifying the inputs: input1 , input2 and output.The architecture body is specifying the internal organization of the gate.(which is very simple because the ’and’ operation is directly used rather than getting a DNF form of the truth table and then implementing it)

# Implementation of 8-bit adder

The 8 bit adder adds two vectors input1 and input2 according to the code in the architecture.It takes two input vectors and gives the output as the timing
diagram in the simulation tool.According to the given code,the hexadecimal and decimal inputs are converted to binary and they are added to obtain the 8-bit output.Since 1+1 = 10 we take the 0 as the output forward and carry forward 1 to the next operation.The output shows the results when we add FF to 00000000.
# Implementation of XOR Gate

The results for the timing diagrams of the XOR gate are correct  and are given in the lab Report.
